# Pho Networks

Pho is an open source online community platform. You can use it to launch your own social network (we call it "a pho network") for small groups, or zillions of users, public or private. It scales up and down automagically, indefinitely, with no human interaction or server maintenance required.

Getting started is as easy as:

1. Download and extract this repo to a folder
2. (optional) Modify
3. Run: pho.php serve
